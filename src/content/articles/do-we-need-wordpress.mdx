###### Introduction

As of January 2025, PHP is used by 74.7% of all the websites "whose server-side programming we know" according to [w3techs.com](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php), which makes me wonder how much of that is attritbuted to WordPress.

According to [colorlib.com](https://colorlib.com/wp/wordpress-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), 472 million websites use WordPress, "which is 43.3% of all the websites on the Internet." It should be noted (same source) that WordPress has a 62.7% share of the CMS market, which is more than 10x greater than its closest competitor.

That means about 58% of all websites are using WordPress. Astronomical.

Some will disagree with me, but I would say that's one of the largest cases of technology lock-in we could ever know. If you're not familiar with the term "tech lock-in", it describes how a framework or technology gains popularity simply because it is widely used. As more people adopt it, more resources are created like documentation, plugins, tooling, community support, etc. which make it easier to continue to use it and perpetuate market dominance.

It creates a cycle where the technology becomes self-reinforcing. Developers use it because it's popular and well-supported, and the popularity further drives its improvement, making it even harder for new or alternative tools to break in.

So it's not so much about the inherent quality of the tool, but rather its ecosystem growing around it, leading to a kind of "default" choice for many people, even if it's not always the best fit for a given project.

And I would posit that given the serious amount of vulnerabilities, reliance on third-party plugins, and the actions of WordPress CEO Matt Mullenweg, WordPress is definitely _not_ good enough to be powering 43% of the Internet.

This is not an attack on WordPress or PHP.
