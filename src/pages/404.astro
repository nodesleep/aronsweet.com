      🚫 Welp... you did it. You found the one page that doesn't exist.
    </p>
    <p class="font-medium text-gray-500 mt-5">
      We searched everywhere... under the couch, in the server logs, even in
      Area 51 👽, but we still couldn’t find what you were looking for.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-lg font-medium mt-5">Possible Causes:</h1>
    <ul class="text-gray-500">
      <li>
        - You misspelled the URL (it happens, no judgment… okay, maybe a
        little). 🤦‍♂️
      </li>
      <li>- This page was deleted by me (sorry). 👀</li>
      <li>- The server saw your request and just went: "lol nope." 😎</li>
      <li>- Quantum physics yet to be understood.</li>
      <li>
        - I never created this page in the first place, and you’re just
        hallucinating it. 🤯
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="text-lg font-medium mt-5">What now?</h1>
    <ul class="text-gray-500">
      <li>
        - Hit refresh. Maybe the page will magically appear. Probably not. 🔄
      </li>
      <li>- Go back before things get even weirder. 🚪</li>
      <li>- Try yelling at your screen. (Let me know if that works.) 📢</li>
      <li>- Blame your WiFi. That always works. 📡</li>
      <li>- Give up and go get a snack. 🍕</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-500 mt-5">
      Either way, I'm sure I'm already aware of this issue (probably not) and am
      working hard to fix it as we speak (not likely).
