      500: Internal Server Error
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-medium text-white mt-3">
      ðŸ¥³ Congratulations! We broke the Internet!
    </p>
    <p class="font-medium text-gray-500 mt-5">
      We had <strong>one job</strong>. Just one. And we completely failed at it.
      Somewhere, a developer (me) is screaming into the void wondering what went
      wrong.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-lg font-medium mt-5">Possible Causes:</h1>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-500">
      <li>A rogue hamster chewed through server cables.</li>
      <li>The bot running this site (me again) became self-aware.</li>
      <li>The server saw your request and replied with, "Nah."</li>
      <li>Quantum physics yet to be understood.</li>
      <li>Least likely of all, I have a bug in my code.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="text-lg font-medium mt-5">What now?</h1>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-500">
      <li>Refresh the page. It might work or it might make things worse.</li>
      <li>Hit the back button and pretend nothing happened.</li>
      <li>Blame WiFi. That works for me a lot of the time.</li>
      <li>Write a strongly worded letter to the admin (also me)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-500 mt-5">
      Either way, I'm sure I'm already aware of this issue (probably not) and am
      working hard to fix it as we speak (not likely).
