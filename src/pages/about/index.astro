    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Aron Sweet</strong> - A frontend and full-stack developer with
      a deep love for creating <strong>engaging web applications</strong>. My
      journey into tech began as a curious kid fascinated by how things worked,
      whether it was the cosmos above or the computer on my desk. Now, with over <strong
        >15 years of professional experience</strong
      >, Iâ€™ve honed my craft, helping businesses and individuals bring their
      ideas to life through
      <strong>clean code</strong> and thoughtful design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Iâ€™m based in the <strong>Central US</strong> where I live with my family and
      grumpy cat, Carl. Beyond my work, Iâ€™m a devoted dad, constantly inspired by
      my 14-year-old daughter, who dreams of becoming a chef and has taught me the
      value of pursuing passions wholeheartedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with a variety of
      companies. At
      <strong>DFN Freight Exchange</strong>, I was the sole developer building a
      <strong>freight-tracking single-page application</strong> from scratch, contributing
      both frontend expertise and backend API design. At <strong
        >OpenTeknik</strong
      >, I developed an
      <strong>in-house CRM</strong> that streamlined client management. More recently,
      Iâ€™ve worked with <strong>Placekey.io</strong>, where I turned Figma
      mockups into
      <strong>pixel-perfect Vue components</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond client work, Iâ€™m also the creator of <strong>TornadoTrax</strong>,
      a web application that serves as a <strong>visual archive</strong> and path
      tracker for every documented tornado in the United States from 1950 to 2022.
      Iâ€™m currently <strong>developing version 2</strong>, which includes a
      revamped <strong>API and client</strong> to enhance functionality and usability
      for weather enthusiasts and researchers alike.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m diving into my other passions. As a guitarist and
      surf music nerd, I spend time exploring the iconic tones of my <strong
        >Fender Jazzmaster</strong
      >. Iâ€™m also fascinated by <strong>astronomy</strong> and <strong
        >psychology</strong
      >, finding ways to create
      <strong>digital experiences</strong> that feel human and meaningful. Iâ€™m a
      fan of
      <strong>The Budos Band</strong>, <strong>The Beatles</strong>, and
      everything in between.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe in giving back to the community and love mentoring budding
      developers. Whether itâ€™s debugging a tricky line of <strong
        >JavaScript</strong
      > or sharing insights about
      <strong>tech trends</strong>, I enjoy connecting with others who share the
      same curiosity and drive to build something extraordinary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, Iâ€™m passionate about <strong>learning</strong>, <strong
        >creating</strong
      >, and making life better through <strong>technology</strong>. If that
      resonates with you, letâ€™s connect and create something amazing together.
